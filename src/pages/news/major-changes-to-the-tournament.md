Due to some unforeseeable problems, “NeCro2018” will no longer be held on 25th & 26th of august, but rather on **25th of August only.**

One of our bigger partners – “Student Centre Stjepan Radić” pulled out of the tournament due to prolonged construction work on their facilities. We are trying hard to find alternatives but it looks like we will have to ask you to find something yourself.

Some other unforeseen logistical problems happened with the gym as well but will in no way affect the tournament on the 25th. 

**The changes to the tournament are as follows:**

**DATE & PLACE:**

•	The tournament will take place on 25th of August, from 10:00 to 17:00 o’clock

•	The tournament will be held in “Bočarski Dom Zrinjevac”, on Prisavlje 2 street in Zagreb

**TIMETABLE:**

•	The tournament will open at 10:00 o’clock and will close at 17:00 o’clock

•	The hall will be open from 09:00 o’clock

•	Registrations for the tournament will start at 09:00 o’clock

**PRICE:**

•	Entrance fee has been lowered to **20 euro per contestant**

**LUNCH:**

•	Lunch is still included in the price

**ACCOMODATIONS:**

•	The organizer can no longer provide accommodations for the participants

•	We kindly ask that you find accomodations by yourself
